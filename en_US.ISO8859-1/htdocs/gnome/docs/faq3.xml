In the past, questions were linked by their question number.  For
example, question 10 would have had the link "#q10".  This has
scalability problems to say the least.  For now on, questions should

<!-- Q Install -->
	    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="install"></a>
	    <p><b>How do I get GNOME &gnomever; for FreeBSD?</b></p>
<!-- A Install -->
<!-- XXX mention mate and cinnamon -->
	    <p>There are two ways to install GNOME &gnomever; on FreeBSD.  One way is to use
	      <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/pkgng-intro.html">
	        packages</a>, and the other way is to use
	      <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports-using.html">
	        ports</a>.  Before doing either installation, you should
		first familiarize yourself with the GNOME &gnomever;
		<a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/&gnomever;/notes/en/">
		release notes</a>.</p>
<!-- XXX check this url -->

		<p><u>Install GNOME &gnomever; from packages.</u></p>

	    <p>To install GNOME &gnomever; from packages, use the command:</p>

	    <tt># pkg add gnome3</tt>

	    <p>This will download the latest GNOME &gnomever; packages from the
	      FreeBSD package server near you, and proceed to install them on your system.
	    </p>

	    <p>To build GNOME &gnomever; from ports, you must first obtain the
	      latest ports tree skeleton.  This is most easily
	      accomplished with <tt>portsnap(8)</tt>
	      Then:</p>

	    <pre>
# cd /usr/ports/x11/gnome3
# make clean
# make install clean
	    </pre>

	    <p>After either step, you still need to <a href="#full-gnome">
	      enable the GNOME services</a> to run e.g. the graphical login
	      automatically on system startup.</p> </li>

<!-- Q Full-GNOME -->
	    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="full-gnome"></a>
	    <p><b>How do I get the most out of GNOME?</b></p>
<!-- A Full-GNOME -->
	    <p>In order to make the most of your new GNOME Desktop,
	      you will want to start all of the GNOME-related services
	      at boot-time.  If you wish to take full advantage of
	      GNOME, add the following to <tt>/etc/rc.conf</tt>:</p>

	    <pre>
gnome_enable="YES"
	    </pre>

	    <p>This will enable services such as GDM, HAL, D-BUS, and
	      Avahi on system startup.  If you do not want to run all
	      of these services, you should forget the
	      <em>gnome_enable</em> property, and manually enable the
	      services you want. Please note that dbus is required.</p>

	    <p>If you do not want to reboot immediately after the
	      installation, you can invoke the following commands:</p>

	    <pre>
# /usr/local/etc/rc.d/dbus start
# /usr/local/etc/rc.d/avahi-daemon start
# /usr/local/etc/rc.d/avahi-dnsconfd start
# /usr/local/etc/rc.d/hald start
# /usr/local/etc/rc.d/gdm start
	    </pre>

	    <p>To start GNOME &gnomever; under X without using GDM,
	      add the following line to <tt>~/.xsession</tt> or
	      <tt>~/.xinitrc</tt>, as appropriate (see
	      <tt>startx(1)</tt>):</p>

	    <pre>
exec ck-launch-session gnome-session
	    </pre>
	    </li>

<!-- Q Failing -->
            <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="failing"></a>
	    <p><b>GNOME &gnomever; is failing to build from ports.  What do
	      I do?</b></p>
<!-- A Failing -->
	    <p>The majority of GNOME &gnomever; compilation problems can be solved
	      by making sure all the necessary GNOME &gnomever; components are
	      <a href="#update">up-to-date</a>.</p>

		<p><u>Updating solves most problems</u></p>

		<p>If you have not yet followed <a href="#update">FAQ update</a>,
		  do so, as it will most likely fix the problem you are
		  reading this document to solve.</p>

		<p>Please follow <a href="#update">FAQ update</a>.  If you have not
		  done so, and you ask for help, you will be told to follow
		  FAQ update item.</p>

	    <p>In general, when a GNOME &gnomever; component is not up-to-date,
	      you will see an error similar to the following:</p>

	      <pre>
checking for libgnomeui-2.0 libbonoboui-2.0 libbonobo-2.0 >= 2.2.1
gnome-vfs-2.0 libgnomeprint-2.2 >= 2.3.0 libgnomeprintui-2.2 libglade-2.0...
configure: error: Library requirements (libgnomeui-2.0 libbonoboui-2.0
libbonobo-2.0 >= 2.2.1 gnome-vfs-2.0 libgnomeprint-2.2 >= 2.3.0 libgnomeprintui-2.2
libglade-2.0) not met; consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
if your libraries are in a nonstandard prefix so pkg-config can find them.
	      </pre>
<!-- XXX convert this to a GNOME 3 errorr -->

	    <p>Simply keeping your ports tree <a href="#update">up-to-date</a> will
	      prevent these errors.</p>

	    <p>If the <tt>pkg-config</tt> program is out-of-date, you may see
	      a configure error similar to the following:</p>

	      <pre>
configure: error: *** pkg-config too old; version 0.14 or better required.
	      </pre>

	      <p>While this may be buried in some other text, the error is
	        very straight-forward: you need to upgrade pkg-config.
		The pkg-config application is found in the
		<tt>devel/pkg-config</tt> port.  By updating this port to
		the latest version, this error will go away.</p>

<!-- XXX is this still needed? check if all supported branches have posix
     thingy enabled by default -->
	      <p>You may see compiler errors relating to pthreads
	      (&posix; threads), such as:</p>

	    <pre>
undefined reference to 'strerror_r'
            </pre>

	    <p>To fix thread related errors, make sure you have the following
	      compiled into your kernel:</p>

	    <pre>
options     _KPOSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING
            </pre>

	    <p>If you are tracking -STABLE or -CURRENT, make sure that you
	      do <b>not</b> have <tt>NO_LIBPTHREAD</tt> set in
	      <tt>/etc/make.conf</tt>. If you do, remove it, then rebuild world.
	      If you still have trouble, please send email to
	      <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">
	      &email;@FreeBSD.org</a> with the output of the failed compilation.
	      It is also helpful to include the config.log from the port's
	      work directory.</p>
	  </li>


<!-- Q Upgrade -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="upgrade"></a>
	    <p><b>What is the best way to upgrade from GNOME &gnomeoldver; to GNOME &gnomever;?</b></p>
<!-- A Upgrade -->
	    <p>The &gnomeoldver; to &gnomever; may have a few
	      caveats.  You are strongly advised to read the
	      <a href="faq314.html">upgrade FAQ</a> for detailed
	      instructions.</p>
	  </li>
<!-- XXX needs to be updated from gnome 2-> gnome 3. Also new question about removeing gnome 2 with mate. -->

<!-- Q update -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="update"></a>
	    <p><b>How do I keep my GNOME &gnomever; components and applications
	      up-to-date?</b></p>
<!-- A update -->
		<p>Package users can keep there installed packages update
		  with the pkg command as mentioned in <a href="&url.books.handbook;/pkgng-intro.html">binary package management handbook chapter</a>.</p>
		<p>Port users are emphatically encouraged to use <tt>portupgrade</tt>
		  or <tt>portmaster</tt> to keep your GNOME
		  &gnomever; components and applications up-to-date.</p>

		<p><u>Update your ports with <tt>portupgrade</tt> or
		  <tt>portmaster</tt>.</u></p>

		<p>Once you have updated your ports tree (presumably with
		  <tt>portsnap</tt>), the following two simple commands will update
		  what needs to be updated, and will prevent inconsistencies:</p>

		<pre>
# portupgrade -a
		</pre>

		<p>OR</p>

		<pre>
# portmaster -a
		</pre>

		<p><u>Start from scratch.</u></p>

	    <p>Despite consistent utilization of <tt>portupgrade</tt>
	      or <tt>portmaster</tt>, if
		  it seems like everything is refusing to build with everything
		  else, you might save yourself a headache or three by removing
		  all your GNOME apps and reinstalling them (your data files will
		  remain untouched).  To do this, follow these commands:</p>

	    <pre>
# pkg delete -r glib
# cd /usr/ports/x11/gnome3
# make clean
# make install clean
	    </pre>
	</li>

<!-- Q Uninstall -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="uninstall"></a>
	    <p><b>How do I uninstall GNOME?</b></p>
<!-- A Uninstall -->
	    <p>We would prefer that you did not uninstall GNOME ;-),
	      but if you must, you have to decide how much you want to
	      uninstall.  If you have installed <tt>x11/gnome2</tt>
	      and you want to remove all Desktop components that do
	      not have other dependent packages, do the following:</p>

	    <pre>
# pkg delete gnome3
	    </pre>

	    <p>This will remove the GNOME Meta port. If you installed
	      GNOME via ports or packages via the meta port
	      (x11/gnome3), then you can use <a href="&url.books.handbook;/pkgng-intro.html#pkgng-autoremove">pkg autoremove</a>
	      to deinstall all the gnome components that are not used by other ports.
	      </p>
&url.doc.langbase;/books/handbook

<!-- XXX run pkg autoremove into man page link -->

	  </li>

<!-- XXX this question seems to be obsolete, or at the very least needs a rework -->
<!-- Q8 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q8"></a>
	    <p><b>Where can I get more themes for GNOME &gnomever;?</b></p>
<!-- A8 -->
		<p>On the following websites, you can find themes for GTK+,
		  metacity, nautilus, GDM, icons, backgrounds, and more:
		</p>

		<ul>
		  <li><a href="http://art.gnome.org">art.gnome.org</a></li>
		  <li><a href="http://www.gnome-look.org">GNOME-look.org</a></li>
		  <li><a href="http://www.themedepot.org">The Theme Depot</a></li>
		  <li><a href="http://themes.freshmeat.net">themes.freshmeat.net</a></li>
		  <li><a href="http://jimmac.musichall.cz/icons.php">Jimmac's Icons site</a></li>
		</ul>

	    <p>Some of these themes have already been ported to
	      FreeBSD.  Check out the <tt>x11-themes/gnome-icons</tt> and
	      <tt>x11-themes/metacity-themes</tt> meta-ports for a nice
	      sample.</p>
	  </li>


<!-- Q10 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q10"></a>
	    <p><b>Does GNOME &gnomever; support anti-aliased fonts?</b></p>
<!-- A10 -->
		<p>Yes!  Anti-aliasing requires X.Org with
		  freetype2 support.  To add freetype2 support to X, make
		  sure you have the following modules loaded in your
		  xorg.conf file under the Modules section:</p>

		<pre>
Load	"freetype"
Load	"type1"
		</pre>

		<p>Then, simply check out the Fonts capplet under
		  Applications->Desktop Preferences.  If you want a good set
		  of TrueType starter fonts, install the
		  <tt>x11-fonts/webfonts</tt> port.</p>

		<p>Sometimes, after adding new fonts to the system, it is
		  necessary to teach fontconfig about them.  If you find that
		  newly added fonts are not made available even after
		  restarting GNOME, run the following command as root:</p>
<!-- XXX this should be done automaticly by now, if not it is a font bug -->
		<pre>
# fc-cache -f -v
		</pre>

		<p>If you have any questions, please send them to
		  <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">&email;@FreeBSD.org</a>.
		</p>
	  </li>

<!-- XXX this question least needs a rework, the location of .fonts.conf has 
     changed and maybe other things too -->
<!-- Q11 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q11"></a>
	    <p><b>How can I control what fonts are anti-aliased?</b></p>
<!-- A11 -->
		<p>GNOME &gnomever; makes use of libXft and fontconfig to
		  handle anti-aliasing.  Fontconfig is a very powerful
		  XML-based font configuration package.  You can create a
		  <tt>~/.fonts.conf</tt> file that controls virtually
		  every aspect of fontconfig.  For example, if you do not
		  want to anti-alias fonts smaller than 16 point, create
		  a <tt>~/.fonts.conf</tt> with the following contents:</p>

		<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd"&gt;
&lt;fontconfig&gt;

&lt;match target="font"&gt;
        &lt;test name="size" compare="less_eq"&gt;
                &lt;double&gt;16&lt;/double&gt;
        &lt;/test&gt;
        &lt;edit name="antialias" mode="assign"&gt;
                &lt;bool&gt;false&lt;/bool&gt;
        &lt;/edit&gt;
&lt;/match&gt;
&lt;match target="font"&gt;
        &lt;test name="pixelsize" compare="less_eq"&gt;
                &lt;double&gt;16&lt;/double&gt;
        &lt;/test&gt;
        &lt;edit name="antialias" mode="assign"&gt;
                &lt;bool&gt;false&lt;/bool&gt;
        &lt;/edit&gt;
&lt;/match&gt;
&lt;/fontconfig&gt;
                </pre>

                <p>Refer to fonts-conf(5) for more information.</p>

	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q12"></a>
	    <p><b>How do I edit my GNOME menus?</b></p>
<!-- A12 -->
	    <p>Right-click on the Applications menu, and select
	      <b>Edit Menus</b>.  This will invoke the

	  </li>

<!-- XXX seems really old, needs review -->
<!-- Q13 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q13"></a>
	    <p><b>How do I use GTK+ resource settings for GTK+ applications
	      when not in a GNOME environment?</b></p>
<!-- A13 -->
	    <p>GNOME applications get their GTK+ resources from themes and
	      the corresponding theme engine.  If you would rather run your
	      GTK+ applications in a non-GNOME environment then you will
	      need to create a file named <tt>~/.gtkrc-2.0</tt>.</p>
	    <p> To use the widgets from a GTK+ theme when in a non-GNOME
	      environment, simply <tt>include</tt> the theme's
	      <tt>gtk-2.0/gtkrc</tt> in your <tt>~/.gtkrc-2.0</tt>. For example:</p>

		  <pre>include "/usr/local/share/themes/Crux/gtk-2.0/gtkrc"</pre>
		<p> If you prefer, you can use the same GTK+ 1.2 theme for both
		  GTK+ 1.2 and GTK+ 2 applications, which will give your GTK+
		  programs a consistent look. For the most part, you can transfer
		  your settings from your <tt>~/.gtkrc</tt> file (used for
		  GTK+ 1.2) with a couple of caveats.</p>

	      <ol>
	        <li> If you have any theme engine references, you will have
		  to make sure there is a corresponding GTK+ theme engine.
		  Otherwise, remove the engine entries.</li>
		<li> The default font specification should be outside of
		  any <tt>style</tt> blocks and should be specified with
		  the <tt>gtk-font-name</tt> keyword.  For example:

		  <pre>gtk-font-name = "Verdana 11"</pre>
		</li>
              </ol>

	        <p> Note that while a GTK+ 1.2 <tt>gtkrc</tt> file will work
		  in a GTK+ 2 <tt>gtkrc-2.0</tt> file, the opposite is <i>not</i>
		  true: the contents of a GTK+ 2 <tt>gtkrc-2.0</tt> file will
		  <i>not</i> work inside a GTK+ 1.2 <tt>gtkrc</tt> file.</p>

		<p>For simply switching GTK+ themes without needing to
		  edit your <tt>~/.gtkrc</tt> files, you can use the
		  <tt>x11/gtk-theme-switch</tt> and
		  <tt>x11/gtk2-theme-switch</tt> ports.</p>
	  </li>

<!-- XXX this needs review, I think cam stuff might have slightly changed. -->
<!-- Q15 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q15"></a>
	    <p><b>Brasero does not let me burn CDs or
	      Totem/Rhythmbox/Sound-juicer cannot find my CD/DVD drive.  How can I
	      fix this?</b></p>
<!-- A15 -->
	    <p>Brasero, totem, rhythmbox, and sound-juicer cannot
	      use CD/DVD drives unless support for those devices is
	      enabled in the kernel, and the permissions on the device
	      nodes allow write access.
	      Brasero, totem, rhythmbox, and sound-juicer talk to
	      CD/DVD drives through the SCSI CAM subsystem.  Therefore,
	      you must make sure you have the following configured in your
	      kernel:</p>

	    <pre>
device          scbus
device          cd
device          pass
	    </pre>

	    <p>You must also make sure you have the following configured in
	      your kernel if you are using an ATAPI CD/DVD drive:</p>

	    <pre>
device		atapicam
	    </pre>

	    <p>Finally, if you are running GNOME 2.16 or later, you
	      must have <a href="&base;/gnome/docs/halfaq.html">
	      HAL running</a>, or you will
	      only be able to burn to an ISO image file.</p>

	    <p>To figure out which CD/DVD drive you will be using, run the
	      following command as root:</p>

	    <pre>
# camcontrol devlist
	    </pre>

	    <p>Your output will look similar to the following:</p>

	    <pre>
&lt;QSI CDRW/DVD SBW-242 UD22&gt;		at scbus1 target 0 lun 0 (cd0,pass0)
	    </pre>

	    <p>The devices in parentheses at the end are important.  You
	      must make sure the <tt>/dev</tt> entries for those devices

<!-- A16 -->
	  <p>The process for adding new GDM sessions has changed substantially

	    now, you must create a <tt>.desktop</tt> file containing the session
	    configuration information.  Session files live in
	    <tt>/usr/local/etc/dm/Sessions</tt>.  For example, to add
	    a KDE session, create a file in <tt>/usr/local/etc/dm/Sessions</tt>
	    called <tt>kde.desktop</tt>.  That file should contain the

	    <p><b>Why is GNOME so slow to start up?</b></p>
<!-- A20 -->
	    <p>Under normal circumstances, GNOME should only take a
	      few seconds to start up (fifteen at most).  However,
	      certain configurations may cause it to hang for up to an
	      hour at login time.</p>

	    <p>First, make sure your machine's hostname properly
	      resolves.  To test this, run the following command:</p>

	    <pre>
ping `hostname`
	    </pre>

	    <p>If the command fails, you will either have to add your
	      fully-qualified hostname to DNS or to <tt>/etc/hosts</tt>.
	      If you do not have a static IP address, you can append
	      your hostname to the <tt>localhost</tt> line in
	      <tt>/etc/hosts</tt>.  For example, if your machine's
	      hostname is <tt>gnome-rocks.mydomain.com</tt>, edit
	      <tt>/etc/hosts</tt>, and change the line:</p>

	    <pre>
127.0.0.1               localhost localhost.my.domain
	    </pre>

	    <p>To:</p>

	    <pre>
127.0.0.1              localhost localhost.my.domain gnome-rocks gnome-rocks.mydomain.com
	    </pre>

	    <p>Finally, if you have either the TCP or UDP blackhole
	      sysctl enabled, this may cause GNOME to stall on login.
	      If, after fixing hostname resolution,
	      GNOME still takes a long time to startup, verify the following
	      sysctls are set to 0:</p>

	    <pre>
net.inet.tcp.blackhole
net.inet.udp.blackhole

	      be added in the future.  This service can be a great way
	      of getting the latest GNOME desktop without having to wait
	      for everything to build from ports.</p>

	    <p>To install packages from the GNOME Tinderbox, you must
	      set the <tt>PACKAGESITE</tt> environment variable to the

<!-- Q22 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q22"></a>
	    <p><b>How do I add new MIME types to GNOME?</b></p>
<!-- A22 -->
	    <p>Since GNOME 2.8, MIME types are stored in the new
	      FreeDesktop shared-mime-info database.  However,
	      gnome-control-center has not been updated to allow
	      one to easily add MIME types to this database.
	      Therefore, if applications such as Nautilus complain
	      that there is no MIME type associated with a particular
	      file, using the <em>Open With</em> tab under Properties
	      not work.</p>

	    <p>New MIME types can be added in one of two places.  They
	      can either be added system-wide for all users, or added
	      locally on a per-user basis.  System-wide MIME types
	      must be added to
	      <tt>LOCALBASE/share/mime</tt> , where as local MIME types
	      must be added to <tt>~/.local/share/mime</tt>.  In
	      both cases, the procedure is the same.</p>

	    <p>To define a new MIME type, you must create an
	      <em>application</em> and a <em>packages</em> file to
	      describe it.  The application file will be named for
	      the MIME type, and contain its name and a brief
	      comment describing it.  The packages file will list
	      all the extensions associated with this MIME type
	      as well as any special file magic that can be used
	      to identify files without an extension.</p>

	    <p>For example, if we wanted to add a new local MIME type for
	      Windows HTML Help files (i.e. .chm files) called
	      <b>application/x-chm</b>, we would do the
	      following.  First, we would create the directories
	      <tt>~/.local/share/mime/application</tt> and
	      <tt>~/.local/share/mime/packages</tt> if they did not
	      already exist.  Then, we create an application file
	      called <tt>x-chm.xml</tt> that we will place in
	      <tt>~/.local/share/mime/application</tt>.  The file
	      looks like:</p>

	    <pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;mime-type
xmlns="http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info"
type="application/x-chm"&gt;
  &lt;comment&gt;Windows HTML Help file&lt;/comment&gt;
&lt;/mime-type&gt;
	    </pre>

	    <p>Next, we create a packages file called <tt>chm.xml</tt>
	      that we will place in
	      <tt>~/.local/share/mime/packages</tt>.  The file looks
	      like:</p>

	    <pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;mime-info
xmlns="http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info"&gt;
  &lt;mime-type type="application/x-chm"&gt;
    &lt;comment&gt;Windows HTML Help file&lt;/comment&gt;
    &lt;glob pattern="*.chm" /&gt;
  &lt;/mime-type&gt;
&lt;/mime-info&gt;
	    </pre>

	    <p>Once the files have been created, the MIME database
	      must be updated.  To do that, run the command:</p>

	    <pre>
% update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime
	    </pre>

	    <p>Finally (and unfortunately), you must logout and log
	      back in to GNOME for the changes to fully take effect.
	      Nautilus' <em>Properties-&gt;Open With</em> interface can now
	      be used to associate an application to this MIME type.
	      Hopefully all of this will be made much easier in a future
	      GNOME release.</p>

	    <p><b>How do I configure GDM for automatic logins?</b></p>
<!-- A23 -->
	    <p>The GNOME Display Manager (GDM) can be configured to
	      automatically log a user in when it starts up.  To do
	      that, you must first configure Pluggable Authentication
	      Module (PAM) support for <em>gdm-autologin</em>.
	      Create a <tt>/etc/pam.d/gdm-autologin</tt> file
	      with the following contents:</p>

	    <pre>
auth       required     pam_permit.so
account    required     pam_nologin.so
account    required     pam_unix.so
session    required     pam_permit.so
	    </pre>

	    <p>Once PAM is configured to allow GDM automatic logins,
	      edit <tt>/usr/local/etc/gdm/custom.conf</tt>, and set
	      <tt>AutomaticLoginEnable="true"</tt>, and
	      <tt>AutomaticLogin</tt> equal to the username for which
	      you wish to enable automatic logins.  Both of these

	    <pre>
[daemon]
AutomaticLoginEnable="true"
